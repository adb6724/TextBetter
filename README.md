# TextBetter
Windows application that uses OpenAI to quickly improve text legibility efficiently and accurately.

Sometimes, I find it difficult to get an accurate response with AI while avoidiing the hassle of a "learning" system. 

I created TextBetter, a project with specificity upon using AI, to generate quick and accurate results.

The text that is generated will not only be better, but it will be tailored to the needs of the original writer.
If more specific requirements are necessary, the user may input parenthesis before their text.

This program uses OpenAI (GPT 3.5 Turbo Instruct)
